# TRIAD Analysis
 An analysis to find if genes or lncRNAs are present in all three (A, B and D) wheat subgenome. 
 
 ## Galaxy workflows
 TRAID analysis for lncRNAs has been done using Galaxy workflow system. 
 ### Workflows
 1. TRIAD_data_prep.ga is Galaxy workflow to prepare datasets 
 2. TRIAD.ga is Galaxy workflow to identify TRIADs 

 ### Dataset
 This analysis needs following dataset
 1. Transcriptome
 2. List of genes for A, B and D sub-genome
